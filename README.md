# strawblox
This repository on GitHub is the home for I Can Make's Strawblox construction system. Versions of the connectors will also be made available on Thingiverse, YouMagine, Cubify and other platforms and can also be downloaded as a zip file from the I Can Make [website](http://www.icanmakehq.com/strawblox)

# Design Principles

The components are all created from a master "ball" which defines the outer bounds of the connectors. Internally there is another ball which defines the end stop for the straws in each of the tubes. Using this simple set of constraints and varying the angles between the connector tubes almost any geometry is possible.

# How to use Strawblox

To make strawblox connectors simply download the .stl files you want, lay them out in your 3D printer software and then print out. The I Can Make website has pre-sliced trays of connectors for some of the most common 3D printers. Once you've printed the connectors simply clean any 3D printing residues/artefacts out from the holes. If the holes are too tight they can be opened up with a simple chopstick. You'll need any 5mm diameter straw such as the [IKEA Soda](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30236233/).
